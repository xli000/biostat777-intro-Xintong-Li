Carried out via computer-assisted personal interviews, the NCS-2 survey targeted the noninstitutionalized civilian population aged 25 to 69 across the 48 contiguous United States. The purpose of this longitudinal survey, including NCS-1 and 2, was to track changes in mental disorders, substance use disorders, predictors of changes, and consequences over the ten-year period. Demographic and background information collected include age, education, employment, household composition, household income, marital status, and region.
